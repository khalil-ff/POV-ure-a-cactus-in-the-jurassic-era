- python game -
A parody of Google’s Chrome Dino game with more assets. not done yet. you still can play it tho !
I have coded a game this year with two of my friends. All of its assets were created by us, whether the music, the art, animations, or the code. It was our first project and the first time I understood how much our bonds got stronger working together. The game was a parody of Google’s Chrome Dino game even though it was a little bit more complex.
